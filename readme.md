The idea is to make a better, more customizable version of
donothingfor2minutes.com, with the style inspired from monkeytype.com

Ideas for features right now:
* Timer
* Stopwatch
* Keep track of total "nothing time"
* Personal records
* Apple TV-esque background content
* Journaling/notes section

Other things to look into:
* How does monkeytype.com store its user data?
* Is it still vanilla JS?


Backgrounds spreadsheet w/ links: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bboTohF06r-fafrImTExAPqM9m6h2m2lgJyAkQuYVJI/edit?pli=1&gid=1684411812#gid=1684411812

todos:
* arrows / keybindings for switching between backgrounds
* failure indicator/try again message when causing the time to reset
* UI customization: move timer, hide timer, etc
  * Understand how the CSS I'm using even works (refresher on position, etc.)
* make background borderless
* are the backgrounds as high res as possible?
* save video links in external json instead of within script.js?
* refactor and split javascript components? Might be premature
* organize video links similar to spread sheet (by location, etc.) and allow location
