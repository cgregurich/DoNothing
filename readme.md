The idea is to make a better, more customizable version of
donothingfor2minutes.com, with the style inspired from monkeytype.com

Ideas for features right now:
* Timer
* Stopwatch
* Keep track of total "nothing time"
* Personal records
* Apple TV-esque background content
* Journaling/notes section

Other things to look into:
* How does monkeytype.com store its user data?
* Is it still vanilla JS?
